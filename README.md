# vagrant-vscode
## Debug PHP project hosted on Vagrant VM with VSCode (Visual Studio Code)

I'm using this environment:
- Vagrant Hosted on Windows 7 (called "Host")
- PHP 7.1 install on **Host**
- VM based on Ubuntu 14.04

### Testing Xdebug on VM
Run this command (pay attention to CamelCase)
```
php -i | grep Xdebug
```
